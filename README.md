# clueless_closet
The Clueless closet project is a three steps project I initiated during the data science bootcamp I just completed at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io). It is inspired by Cher's closet from the movie Clueless (1995), movie friends kept referencing when I would talk to them about my project. 
If you're unfamiliar with Clueless (1995), here is a [YouTube video for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU). 

Cher's closet consists of three different processes : 
1. image classification of fashion products images (e.g "pants" vs "tops" vs "shoes" vs "bags")
2. scoring from 0 to 10 how well different pieces go together
3. provide recommendations for improvement if the score is lower than 5

Within the scope of my program at BrainStation, I focused on the first step and used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named MobileNet to classify images from a dataset available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small). 
With time, I'll keep working at it and improve the performance of my neural network as well as finding solutions to step 2 and 3. 

I'm totally open to feedback and suggestions.
